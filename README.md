# 👋 Hi, I'm Babak Esmaeili

I’m a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Michigan State University, specializing in model-free safe control design for autonomous systems.

🔍 **My research focuses on**:
- Safe motion planning and control for autonomous systems
- Risk-aware and model-free reinforcement learning control
- Adaptive and iterative learning control for exoskeletons and multi-agent systems
- ROS/Gazebo-based development for autonomous vehicle control

💡 I enjoy solving complex engineering problems and developing elegant, mathematically grounded solutions.

📫 Feel free to reach out for collaboration or questions: esmaeil1@msu.edu.
